# Strain Gauge Based Paddle

This paddle is deisgned to read the impact force via built-in PCB strain guage. Current design files are available in this repository, while functional do not represent the final working design. Errors are being corrected.

Using the smallest traces available from JLCPCB we embeded this pattern to be used as a strain guage. It its biased towards deflection in the length of the paddle.
